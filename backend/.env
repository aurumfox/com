# REQUIRED: Uncomment and set this for real Solana interactions.
SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet # Good default for development

# SOLANA_RPC_URL: The URL for the Solana RPC node.
# In production, it's HIGHLY recommended to use a reliable RPC provider
# like QuickNode, Alchemy, or Helius for stability and performance.
# REQUIRED: Uncomment and set this for real Solana interactions.

# --- SECURE WALLET OPERATIONS (FOR BACKEND) ---
# IMPORTANT: NEVER STORE PRIVATE KEYS DIRECTLY IN PRODUCTION! This is a SERIOUS SECURITY RISK.
# For production, use a Key Management Service (KMS) such as AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or Azure Key Vault.

# BACKEND_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY: The backend wallet's private key in base58 encoding.
# Use ONLY for local development and testing! Keep this commented out or unset in production.
# THIS SHOULD BE STORED SECURELY, NOT DIRECTLY IN .env FOR PRODUCTION
# BACKEND_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_encoded_private_key_for_development

# For production, instead of a private key, you will use a KMS identifier or ARN:
# BACKEND_WALLET_KMS_KEY_ID=arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id
# BACKEND_WALLET_KMS_REGION=us-east-1 # Example for AWS KMS
# BACKEND_WALLET_KMS_TYPE=AWS # e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure

# MARKETPLACE_OWNER_WALLET_ADDRESS: The Solana wallet address of the marketplace owner.
# This wallet will receive platform fees.

# IPFS_API_KEY=your_ipfs_service_api_key
# IPFS_API_SECRET=your_ipfs_service_api_secret
# IPFS_GATEWAY_URL: The base URL for retrieving content from IPFS.
# IPFS_GATEWAY_URL=https://ipfs.io/ipfs/
# PINATA_JWT: For Pinata's newer JWT-based authentication. More secure than API key/secret.
# PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt

# --- AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY SETTINGS ---
# JWT_SECRET: A very strong, random string for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
# Generate a strong, unique key for production (e.g., using `openssl rand -base64 64`).
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_please_change_this_in_production_AND_MAKE_IT_LONGER_AND_RANDOM # Increased length recommendation
# JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME: Expiration time for JWTs (e.g., '1h', '7d').
